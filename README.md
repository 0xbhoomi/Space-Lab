# Space Lab 
Space Lab is a virtual space research lab that explores how real-world space science concepts can be simulated and understood through software. This project focuses on building interactive models
of space-related systems such as satellites, missions, and basic scientific experiments.
The main idea behind Space Lab is to combine programming with space science in a practical way. Instead of only learning theory, this project tries to represent how things like satellite movement, 
data collection, and space experiments could work in a simplified digital environment.
## What this project does
- Simulates space-related experiments and systems  
- Models basic concepts like satellites, orbits, and missions  
- Provides an educational platform to learn space science using code  
- Encourages learning by building and experimenting  
## Why I built this
I built Space Lab to learn more about space science and technology while improving my programming skills. Space has always been an area of interest for me, and this project helps me understand how real
space missions and systems can be represented using software.
## Tech Stack
- Programming language: (write Python / JavaScript / etc.)
- Tools/Frameworks: (write any libraries or tools you used)
- Platform: (web / desktop / command line)
## Future Scope
In the future, Space Lab can be expanded with:
- More realistic simulations  
- Visual representations of orbits and missions  
- Real data from space agencies  
- User interaction and dashboards  
## Goal
The goal of Space Lab is to make learning space science more interactive and practical by using programming as a tool to explore and simulate real-world concepts.
